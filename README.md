Pig game with two dice. Beautiful Interface and allows players set the desired winning score.

RULES OF THE GAME :

Desired WINNING SCORE can be set by the players to fit their needs and desired duration of the game.

This game can be played by 2 people, one after the other.


For each round of play, the current player rolls the dices by clicking the PLAY button and dice values will be added to player's CURRENT SCORE.


While playing, current player can add his/her current score to the main score area clicking ADD SCORE.


Once ADD SCORE is clicked, it becomes the turn of the next player to play.


If current player keeps playing without adding his/her current score to main score, all the current score value deletes as soon as player gets a 1 from any of the dices. This means that player will lose all current score once he/she gets any dice value of one.


And it becomes the next player's turn to play.

The first player to reach the inputed winning score wins the game.

If no winning score was set, the first player to reach a main score of 100 wins.
